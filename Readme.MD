# Will replace/remove songs if requested, just wanted to update the addon and add some new music. 
Full credit for the inital project goes to [jordodo](https://github.com/jordodo) for the original [Bloodlust Music Addon](https://github.com/jordodo/BloodlustMusic)

I did reach out via Curse messaging, but got no reply. 

Special thanks to Ness, Bagel, Shashu, Artimest, Grimlock, AvatarTouka, Fuzz, and my son for some of the song suggestions.
